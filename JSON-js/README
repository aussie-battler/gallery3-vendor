DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure git export of what's in the tree on github
  https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what we need in gallery3/trunk/lib


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to <COMMIT_ID>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated modified to <COMMIT_ID>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3 -p3

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ php index.php test # run tests
$ git commit -m "Updated JSON-js to <COMMIT_ID>"

$ cd gallery3-vendor/JSON-js && git push
$ cd gallery3 && git push

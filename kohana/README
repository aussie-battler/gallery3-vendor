DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are two directories:

upstream:
  This is a pure svn export of what's in the Kohana svn tree
  http://source.kohanaphp.com/trunk

modified:
  This is a version that's been programmatically altered to be
  what need in gallery3/trunk/kohana


UPDATING
--------
$ sh refresh_upstream.sh    # Pay attention to the Kohana revision number.
$ git commit -m "Updated upstream to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" upstream

$ sh refresh_modified.sh
  # Examine what's in modified and make sure that we only add files
  # here that we want to go into Gallery3.  Anything that we don't
  # want should get added to the filters in refresh_modified.sh and
  # run it again.

$ git commit -m "Updated modified to r<REVISION_NUMBER>" modified
$ git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 | patch -d ../../gallery3 -p3

$ cd ../../gallery3
$ php index.php test # run tests
$ git commit -m "Updated Kohana to r<REVISION_NUMBER>"

$ cd gallery3-vendor/kohana && git push
$ cd gallery3 && git push

NOTES
-----
* When we upgrade to Kohana 2.4, try to replace
  locales::locale_from_http_request() with request::accepts_language()

VERIFYING PATCHES
-----------------

We have some patches in our version of the Kohana code.  After every
update, you should verify that every one of our deviations is tracked
by a Kohana ticket.

To see the differences you can run a diff command
$ diff -r modified/system ../../gallery3/system

Expected differences:
  * http://dev.kohanaframework.org/issues/2477  Don't use Last_Modified header for expires handling
  * http://dev.kohanaframework.org/issues/2640  This is fixed in Kohana SVN, we cherry-picked SVN changeset r4827.
    There should be no diff after the next full Kohana upstream update.
  * http://dev.kohanaframework.org/issues/3060  text::limit_chars() should use UTF-8 delimiter
  * http://dev.kohanaframework.org/issues/2923  having() in Database_Builder is broken
  * http://dev.kohanaframework.org/issues/3317  request::user_agent("robot") fails with PHP 5.3
